## Development process
We made this application using a Scrum methodology. We had an initial design sprint, (sprint 0) and two development sprints. By the two sprints we had a working MVP that we tested in a real setting with real users. This lay the ground for our next sprint.


## Design 
The application layout was made in Figma, and programmed using Materiale Design Kit for react, for faster developement and reconisble design features.
